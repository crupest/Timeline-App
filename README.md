# Welcome to Timeline App

**This project is no longer under development!**
I turned to React for this project. See new project [here](https://github.com/crupest/Timeline-React).

This is the front-end of my first web app called **Timeline**.

It is built with [Angular](https://angular.io/).

The back-end project can be found [here](https://github.com/crupest/Timeline).

The project uses [yarn](https://www.yarnpkg.com) as package manager.

Build this project as a normal angular application project.

``` bash
$ yarn install # install dependency
$ yarn start # run dev server
$ yarn build --prod # build for production
$ yarn test # run unit tests
```
